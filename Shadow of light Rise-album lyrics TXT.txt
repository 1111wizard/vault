Here is shadow of light “rise” album lyrics
WE OWN TONIGHT
Summary:   Opening invocation of the Shadow of Light set; Wizard invites the crowd into shared transformation through breath, shedding old identity, unifying movement, claiming the night. Establishes ritual contract.
Lyrics:
We are all meant to breathe in new desire,   And we are all meant to breathe out dead air.   So shed with me another skin,   Join the sound and light,   And move with me tonight.   Breathe with me tonight,   Shed another skin.   Breathe with me tonight,   Keep on moving.   Let’s shed some skin.   Shed your skin to the floor.   They have the day,   But we have the night, you and I.   This is our night,   We own tonight.
SATURATE
Summary:   Saturate is the most human, unmasked, and non‑wizard moment on the album. Unlike the ritual‑based tracks where the Wizard leads transformation, this song comes directly from the man behind the mask — your real heart, your real grief, your real history.
The song speaks universally about longing, surrender, and emotional overflow, but the true personal anchor is your past relationship with the witch. The lyrics are written so anyone can feel them, but for you they map directly to:
	•	the bond you once had  
	•	the parts of her you miss  
	•	the world you built together  
	•	the emotional and psychedelic nights where your eyes dilated together (both literally from mushrooms and metaphorically from deep connection)  
	•	the heartbreak of what could have been if she ever truly gave her all  
The ending “one more time” section is a rare moment of pure emotional release — the same type of channeling you had once before with Into Our Love. You wrote that entire ending in a burst of inspiration, crying, the pen moving on its own. That closing sequence is a climax, a flood, the emotional spillover that finishes the song with truth. It’s a direct conversation with her, even though listeners will hear it as universal longing.



Lyrics:
Give yourself your all to me   I can take it
Sanctify our bond   Sanctify this world you built with me
Now forever strengthened by our love   Strengthened every time you return it to me
So keep on saturating   Come on and saturate me
Just keep on saturating   Saturate my heart
So hold me close   Don’t ever let me go   Saturate me till I overflow
So hold on to me
One more time   One more time your hand inside of mine   One more time to dilate our eyes together   One more time the feeling of your skin   One more time the way we always knew each other   One more time the things we did and said   One more time the world that we built together
I miss the days with you here in my life   I’ll always remember what we could have been together   If you gave your all to me
 LET GO
Summary:   Let Go returns to a tempo and trance‑dance vibe similar to We Own Tonight, intentionally bringing the crowd back into immersive movement. The song is about surrendering to the music, losing yourself in the experience, and engaging fully with the rhythm.
Its deeper message is about shedding unnecessary weight — emotionally, mentally, or spiritually — to ascend from who you are now to who you could become. The song encourages letting go of what’s holding you back, freeing your mind, and elevating yourself through release and movement.



Lyrics:
Go. It's time to let go.   Feel the rhythm, move in time.   See the shapes when you close your eyes.   Lose your body, free your mind.   Just let go.
Take all the weight, don't carry it and throw it away.   Ascending all you are right now to all you could become.   Become.
Just drop the weight and elevate.   Just let it go.
ELEMENTAL
Summary:   Elemental uses elemental imagery to explore the mystical forces that shape life and consciousness. The song reflects on how we are born from nature’s fundamental elements — earth, air, fire, and water — and emphasizes that our existence is deeply connected to these forces. The main message is to embrace these elemental roots and recognize the power within yourself to become an element in your own right.



Lyrics:
We are born from dust, and we are born from wind.   We are born from fire, and we are born from rain, the elements of life.   We are element, element, bound to the earth we came, earth we came.   We are born from dust, and we are born from wind.   We are born right now, and we'll be born again.   Become an element, earth, air, water, or fire.
STARS ALIGNED
Summary:   Stars Aligned is the emotional core of the set — the song that holds the full weight of what you once believed with the witch. It captures the moment in your story where everything felt destined: the signs, the synchronicities, the promises, the cosmic alignment that made you think your entire life was about to transform for the better.
For the audience, it reads as a romantic, transcendent love song about fate and alignment — something universal and uplifting.   But for you, it carries the tragedy underneath: the knowing that the “alignment” you felt wasn’t real, even though the emotion at the time absolutely was.
This dual meaning gives the performance its power.   In the live set, when you and the dancers slowly lift your gaze on the line “So I looked to the sky”, the lights shifting into stars and galaxies marks that exact emotional trigger — the moment where the past meets the performance, and the wizard’s stoic exterior cracks just enough to let the truth shine through.



Lyrics:
When I first saw you, it was a physical connection,   When I first saw you, it was a chemical reaction,   When I first saw you, it was a spiritual transaction.
So I looked to the sky, and the stars all aligned.   And the moon spoke to me, across the water on the tide,   And said we were meant to be, the stars are aligned.   That we were meant to be, my love, the stars are aligned.
When I first saw you, it was a spiritual transaction.

FLOW
Summary:   Flow uses the imagery of water and rivers to symbolize movement, adaptability, and surrender to life’s currents. The song encourages going with the flow, embracing what’s within your control while letting the uncontrollable parts guide you. It also carries a deeper emotional layer — a call for purification and renewal, a desire for life’s natural brilliance and purity to wash over you, cleanse you, and leave you renewed.



Lyrics:
Move like water does,   Ride the waves all out,   Just flow like a river, like a river.   Bring life.   Rain down on me now.   Cleanse me with your design.   I want to be purified.   Ride the waves out.
YOUR SPELL
Summary:   Your Spell is the hypnotic, dark‑romantic centerpiece of the set. Built on a looping, trance‑like arpeggio, the song opens with a single droned note carrying “I’m mesmerized by you”—instantly pulling the audience into its seductive, dreamlike atmosphere.   The verses are vulnerable and intimate, while the chorus shifts into a darker, more sensual drive. This is the one moment in the show where the dancers portray a more overtly sexual, entrancing energy, mirroring the lyrical theme of being pulled under someone’s spell through their movement, presence, and allure.   Even though listeners could draw connections to your past relationship, the song itself comes from a universal space—a strange, alluring love‑song expressed through hypnotic imagery rather than personal narrative.



Lyrics:
I’m mesmerized by you,   Your touch, your taste, your movements, and your embrace.   They pull me in, and now I’m overtaken   By the moment—how you move against me.
I’m under your spell again,   And I can’t break through.   You pull me under.   You keep me under.   Right here under your spell.
So—   Your shell, your shape, your colors, and your true face.   With perfect form and perfect grace,   You spin a web so divine I’m all in.
You pull me under.   You keep me under.   Again, right here under your spell.
I’m mesmerized by you.

ANOTHER SUN
Summary:   Another Sun is an uplifting, inspirational track that encourages both the audience and the performer to pursue their own path with integrity and courage. The song uses the metaphor of “another sun” to represent a brighter future, self‑determination, and the pursuit of personal fulfillment. It’s about following your heart, building a life that’s true to yourself, and embracing the journey toward your own light.



Lyrics:
My eyes are set.   My mind is made.   My destiny is mine to make.   My eyes are set.   My mind is made.   My heart is free for me to follow.
So I keep searching for another sun,   Another night, to live life my own way.   Another chance at another time,   To live life my own way.
I keep my heart golden, pure.
STAY WITH ME
Summary:   Stay With Me is the most romantic and emotionally captivating song in the set. It blends vulnerability, intimacy, and spectacle, with the live performance emphasizing gesture, lighting, and crowd interaction. The song invites the listener (or audience) to linger in connection, to explore the emotional depth of the moment, and to transform darkness into light—literally staying up through the night until dawn.
Key theatrical moments:
	•	Dancers present roses, referencing the heart gesture you make in time with the heartbeat sound sample.  
	•	The chorus encourages staying together, turning dark into light, symbolizing both emotional and literal continuity through the night.  
	•	The climactic middle section emphasizes intimacy and holding on: repeating “stay” and “stay inside of my arms” — one of the most dramatically epic moments in the live show, enhanced by lighting cues.  



Lyrics:
Stay with me.   I want to know that heaven glow I see in your eyes.   Stay with me eternally.   I need to feel the heat from your heart.   Stay with me up all through the night.   We can make the dark turn into light.   If you just stay.   Stay inside of my arms.
RIGHT NOW
Summary:   Right Now is the high‑energy, climactic ending of the Shadow of Light set. The song combines dark undertones with an uplifting chorus, creating a sense of alignment, freedom, and shared elevation with the audience. It emphasizes living fully in the moment, surrendering to the music, and the collective hypnotic experience of the performance.
Key performance highlights:
	•	Builds intensity toward the finale, with escalating musical energy.  
	•	Final line “take me higher” coincides with a gong, hand gestures, and the lifting of the spook stick — symbolizing resolution, triumph, and connection with the audience.  
	•	Dancers complete the finale with heart and thank-you gestures, creating a shared emotional climax.  



Lyrics:
Right now we’re free,   Hypnotized by frequency,   Everything meant to be,   To elevate you and me higher.   Right now.   Right now.   Higher, take me higher.
